    <h2>About my family</h2>
    <p>
      I am Vishwanath, born on <strong>November 07, 1985</strong> in a Hindu Brahmin family.
      My birthplace is <strong>Uttarkashi</strong>, a city closely associated with Lord Vishwanath,
      the “Swami of the whole world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      My village is <strong>Idak</strong>, which comes under <strong>Banal Patti</strong>, a beautiful village
      situated on the bank of the river <strong>Yamuna</strong>. Growing up in this environment has deeply
      influenced my values and connection to nature and spirituality.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father is now retired from government service, and my mother is a homemaker.
      Whatever we have become today is largely because of her ambitions, dedication,
      and countless sacrifices. I am always grateful to my parents for their support and guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>Friends &amp; Community</h2>
    <p>
      I have been fortunate to have many friends throughout my life, but a few names have become
      an integral part of my personal and professional journey:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dr. Vijay Bhaskar Semwal</li>
      <li>Dr. Vinod Pundir</li>
      <li>Ashish Nautiyal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These friends and colleagues have supported me in various phases of life, and I value
      their friendship, guidance, and collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy visiting beautiful places, especially in <strong>Uttarakhand</strong>,
      and have also spent memorable time in <strong>Daejeon (South Korea)</strong>,
      <strong>Erlangen</strong> and <strong>Nuremberg (Germany)</strong>. Traveling and
      meeting new people from different cultures is something I truly enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main passion, however, is <strong>research</strong>. I am particularly interested in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human gait analysis</li>
      <li>Soft robotics</li>
      <li>Computer vision</li>
      <li>Natural language processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These areas inspire me to keep learning, exploring new ideas, and contributing
      to the scientific community.

      (Coming soon) I plan to add some personal photos here from my village Idak, Uttarkashi,
      and my travels to South Korea and Germany.
